\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduced a kernel-based framework for performing component analysis of normals. We linked existing projection methods, the azimuthal equidistant projection and principal geodesic analysis, to a unified framework. We show that, with the help of our kernel-based formulation, component analysis can be performed directly upon normals without transformation. We also propose a new robust kernel for performing component analysis on normals. In particular, our new kernel based on the angular distance, shows qualitative and quantitative improvement over existing techniques in both artificial reconstruction and SFS settings.
