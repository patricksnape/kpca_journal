We presented robust and efficient approaches to gradient descent alignment of 3D images. Our approaches involve maximising the gradient correlation coefficient formulated by parameterising the image normals in two distinct ways. We showed that both formulations, the inner product and azimuth and elevation differences, are analytically robust to bias field corruption. Our experimental evaluation shows that both of our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art 2D alignment algorithms extended into 3D. However, the increased robustness of our proposed technique does not sacrifice efficiency. Our implementation in Matlab takes $\approx 4$ seconds in comparison with $\approx 3$ seconds for the 3D LK algorithm for a 65x60x100 image. In conclusion, our algorithm is significantly more robust than those compared, for images with outliers caused by bias fields and occlusions.
